However, it does not release energy directly; the energy stored in glucose is then released during respiration. \n\nIngestion: \nThis is the process of taking in food, but it doesn't involve the release of energy. \n\nAbsorption: \nThis is the process of nutrients being absorbed from the digestive tract into the bloodstream, also not involving energy release.",

This means $800 is 85% of the cost price (CP), since 100% - 15% = 85%.\n\nTo find the CP:  \nCP = 800 / 0.85 = 800 × (100/85) = 800 × (20/17) ≈ 941.176 (exact value is 800 × 20 / 17 = 16000 / 17).\n\nFor a 25% profit, the selling price (SP) should be 125% of the CP (100% + 25% = 125%).\n\nSP = CP × 1.25 = (16000 / 17) × 1.25 = (16000 / 17) × (5/4) = (16000 × 5) / (17 × 4) = 80000 / 68.\n\nSimplify 80000 / 68:  \nDivide numerator and denominator by 4: 20000 / 17 ≈ 1176.4706.\n\nThus, to earn a 25% profit, the article should be sold at $1176.47 (rounded to two decimal places).",

    "explanation": "Let the rates of work for A, B, and C be a, b, and c respectively, representing the fraction of the job they complete per day.  \nBased on the given information:  \nA and B can finish the job in 10 days, so their combined rate is 1/10.  \na + b = 1/10     (1)  \nB and C can finish the job in 18 days, so their combined rate is 1/18.  \nb + c = 1/18     (2)  \n\nStep 2: Set up the equation for the total work done  \nThe total work done is the sum of the work done by each person. The total job is considered 1 unit of work.  \nA worked for 5 days: 5a  \nB worked for 10 days: 10b  \nC worked for 15 days: 15c  \nThe total work is:  \n5a + 10b + 15c = 1     (3)  \n\nStep 3: Simplify and solve the system of equations  \nWe can rearrange equation (3) to group the terms:  \n5a + 5b + 5b + 15c = 1  \nFactor out 5 from the first two terms:  \n5(a + b) + 5b + 15c = 1  \nSubstitute the value of (a + b) from equation (1):  \n5(1/10) + 5b + 15c = 1  \n1/2 + 5b + 15c = 1  \n5b + 15c = 1 - 1/2  \n5b + 15c = 1/2     (4)  \nNow, we have a system of two equations with two variables, b and c:  \nb + c = 1/18  \n5b + 15c = 1/2  \nMultiply the first equation by 5 to eliminate b:  \n5(b + c) = 5(1/18) implies 5b + 5c = 5/18  \nSubtract this new equation from equation (4):  \n(5b + 15c) - (5b + 5c) = 1/2 - 5/18  \n10c = 9/18 - 5/18  \n10c = 4/18 = 2/9  \n^^c = 2/(9 x 10) = 2/90 = 1/45^^  \nThe rate of work for C is 1/45 of the job per day.  \n\nAnswer:  \nC alone would take 45 days to finish the whole job.",

Since the cost price (Rs. 800) is greater than the new selling price (Rs. 792), the shopkeeper would still incur a loss.  \nThe amount of the loss is:  \nLoss = CP - New SP = 800 - 792 = 8  \nThe loss is Rs. 8.  \n\nStep 3: Calculate the loss percent  \nNow, we can find the loss percentage for the new selling price using the formula:  \nLoss percent = (Loss / CP) × 100  \nSubstituting the values:  \nLoss percent = (8 / 800) × 100 = 800 / 800 = 1  \nThe loss percent is 1%.",

    "explanation": "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given series: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, (.....), 256.\n\n1. Identify the Pattern:\nThe numbers in the series are powers of 2:\n- 1 = 2^0\n- 2 = 2^1\n- 4 = 2^2\n- 8 = 2^3\n- 16 = 2^4\n- 32 = 2^5\n- 64 = 2^6\n- (.....) = 2^7\n- 256 = 2^8\n\n2. Find the Missing Term:\nFrom the pattern, we can see that the missing term corresponds to 2^7.\n^^- 2^7 = 128^^\n\n3. Conclusion:\nTherefore, the missing term in the series is 128.\n\nFinal Answer:\n(b) 128",

Unlike a single food chain, which is a linear sequence (e.g., grass → rabbit → fox), a food web includes multiple interlinked chains, reflecting the diverse feeding relationships in nature, making \"Interlinked multiple food chains\" the correct answer, as the other options oversimplify the concept.",

    "explanation": "The number is 611611611611.\n\nFormula used:\n\nDivisibility Rules:\n1. A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.\n2. A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.\n\nCalculation:\n\nCheck for divisibility by 6:\n1. Divisibility by 2: The last digit is 1, which is not even. Hence, 611611611611 is not divisible by 2.\n2. Divisibility by 3: Sum of the digits = 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 32. Since 32 is not divisible by 3, 611611611611 is not divisible by 3.\nSince the number is not divisible by both 2 and 3, it is not divisible by 6.\n\n\nCheck for divisibility by 11:\nSum of digits in odd positions = 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 = 16\nSum of digits in even positions = 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 = 16\nDifference = 16 - 16 = 0\nSince the difference is 0, 611611611611 is divisible by 11.\n\n⇒ 611611611611 is ^^divisible by 11 only.^^",
